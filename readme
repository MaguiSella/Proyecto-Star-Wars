# Star Wars Project - NLP

In this project three of the Star War's movie scripts were analyzed and processed using NLP. 
Firstly, a simple word frequency count was performed to see which the most relevant characters are.

Then a word frequency count was performed, followed by stop word removal and tokenization to generate word clouds for two characters: Yoda and Vader.

Next, the whole dialogue was processed, dealing with upper and lower cases, lemmanization and tokenization all in one place. 
Also a count vectorizer was used to understand which words are common in the trilogy and thus, should carry less weight in the analysis.

Lastly, sentiment analysis using Vader was performed, in the processed dialogues with and without lemmanization, concluding that the difference is not great and that lemmanization
should thus not be used.
